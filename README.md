# findus ‚Äì Chat with Gemini

findus is an **async Django-powered** chat application that integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite to deliver AI conversations and on-the-fly grammar feedback.
Each conversation is stored separately, making it easy to revisit past chats, while a modern responsive interface keeps the experience pleasant on desktop and mobile.

## ‚ú® Features

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Async Django architecture** | Built with Django's native async views and async ORM for superior performance and concurrency. |
| **Gemini API integration** | Sends user prompts to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite using async HTTP calls. |
| **Conversation management** | Each chat is grouped under a `Conversation` record with its own URL (`/conversation/<id>/`). |
| **Grammar / spelling analysis** | Background grammar analysis using `asyncio.create_task()` for true non-blocking processing. |
| **Responsive UI** | Flex-box chat layout, mobile-first design, dark-on-light colour scheme. |
| **Real-time UX** | Typing indicator, automatic scrolling, grammar results appear without page refresh. |
| **Code quality** | Pre-commit hooks run **Black**, **Flake8**, and **Mypy** on every commit. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/findus.git
cd findus

# 2. Install latest Python (‚â•3.13) e.g. via Homebrew
brew install python

# 3. Create & activate a virtualenv
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Configuration

Sensitive settings such as API keys are **not** hard-coded in the
repository. Instead they are loaded from an environment file at runtime.

1. Copy the provided template and edit it locally
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Obtain your **Google Gemini** API key from
   https://ai.google.dev/
3. Open the new `.env` file and replace the placeholder:
   ```text
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_api_key_here
   ```

The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore`, so your credentials will **never**
be committed to version control.

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
# Run database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Start the async development server with ASGI
python manage.py runserver
# Note: Django's development server automatically uses ASGI when async views are detected
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ‚Äì a new conversation is created automatically.
Use **+ New Conversation** in the header to start additional threads.

## üõ† Development

### Pre-commit hooks

```bash
# one-time install
pre-commit install
```

On every commit the following run automatically:

1. **Black** ‚Äì auto-formats code (`line-length = 88`)
2. **Flake8** ‚Äì linting (`max-line-length = 100`, ignores `E203,W503`)
3. **Mypy** ‚Äì static typing (`strict`, Django stubs enabled)

Run manually with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Running tests

```bash
python manage.py test
```

The test suite includes comprehensive async tests covering:
- Async view functionality
- Background task processing
- AI service integration (mocked)
- Database operations with async ORM

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Python 3.13
- **Django 5.2 with ASGI** (async views and ORM)
- **Asyncio** for background task processing
- Pydantic AI with Google GenAI client (`google-genai`)
- HTML / CSS / Vanilla JS (no front-end framework)
- SQLite (default) with `CONN_MAX_AGE: 0` for async compatibility
- Pre-commit + Black + Flake8 + Mypy for code quality

### Async Architecture Benefits

- **Better Concurrency**: Handles many more concurrent requests without blocking threads
- **Non-blocking Background Tasks**: Grammar analysis runs asynchronously using `asyncio.create_task()`
- **Improved Performance**: Async ORM queries don't block the event loop
- **Modern Django Patterns**: Uses Django's built-in async support rather than sync/async adapters

## üöÄ Deployment

### ASGI Server Requirements

Since this application uses Django's async views, it requires an **ASGI server** for deployment (not WSGI). Popular options include:

```bash
# Using Uvicorn (recommended for development/testing)
pip install uvicorn
uvicorn findus.asgi:application --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Using Daphne (Django's reference ASGI server)
pip install daphne
daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 findus.asgi:application

# Using Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers (recommended for production)
pip install gunicorn uvicorn[standard]
gunicorn findus.asgi:application -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker
```

### Production Considerations

- Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in settings.py
- Set `DEBUG = False` for production
- Use environment variables for `SECRET_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `LOGFIRE_KEY`
- Consider using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for better async performance
- The database is configured with `CONN_MAX_AGE: 0` for async compatibility
