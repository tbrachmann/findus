# findus ‚Äì Chat with Gemini

findus is a Django-powered chat application that integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite to deliver AI conversations and on-the-fly grammar feedback.
Each conversation is stored separately, making it easy to revisit past chats, while a modern responsive interface keeps the experience pleasant on desktop and mobile.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Python 3.13
- Django 5.2
- Google GenAI client (`google-genai`)
- HTML / CSS / Vanilla JS (no front-end framework)
- SQLite (default) ‚Äì easily swap for Postgres/MySQL in `settings.py`
- Pre-commit + Black + Flake8 + Mypy for code quality
